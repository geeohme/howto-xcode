## Coding Intelligence Deep Dive

### What is Coding Intelligence in Xcode 26?

Coding Intelligence (also called "Coding Assistant") is Apple's native AI integration in Xcode 26 that provides:
- **Context-aware code generation** from natural language
- **Intelligent code explanation** for understanding complex code
- **Automated bug fixing** with AI-suggested solutions
- **Documentation generation** with proper Swift formatting
- **Test creation** for existing functions and classes
- **Architecture guidance** based on your project structure

### Default AI Model: ChatGPT

**Built-in without account:**
- GPT-5 (default) - Fast, high-quality results for most coding tasks
- GPT-4.1 - Alternative model option
- GPT-5 Reasoning - Spends more time thinking for complex problems
- Free tier available with limited requests

**With paid OpenAI account:**
- More requests per hour
- Access to latest models
- Configure in: Xcode > Settings > Intelligence

### Adding Claude Sonnet 4

**Why use Claude?**
- Larger context window (better for large codebases)
- Strong reasoning for architectural decisions
- Excellent at code refactoring
- Alternative perspective on solutions

**Setup Process:**
1. Go to console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
2. Generate an API key (requires paid Claude Pro/Team/Enterprise)
3. Open Xcode > Settings > Intelligence
4. Click "Add a Model Provider"
5. Enter:
   - **URL:** `https://api.anthropic.com/`
   - **API Key:** Your generated key
   - **API Key Header:** `x-api-key`
6. Save and select "Anthropic" in the Coding Assistant dropdown

### Using Other AI Models

**OpenRouter.io (Multi-Model Access):**
- Single API key for multiple models
- Access Claude, GPT, Gemini, LLaMA, DeepSeek, Qwen3, and more
- Cost-effective for testing different models
- Configure as custom provider with OpenRouter endpoint

**Local Models (Privacy-Focused):**
- **Ollama:** Run models like Llama 3, CodeLlama locally
- **LM Studio:** User-friendly interface for local models
- No API costs, complete privacy
- Configure local endpoint in Intelligence settings

**Google Gemini:**
- Add via API key from Google AI Studio
- Configure custom endpoint for Gemini API

### Best Practices for AI Coding Assistants

1. **Be Specific:** Provide clear, detailed prompts with context
2. **Iterate:** Start with basic requests, refine based on results
3. **Review AI Code:** Always review and test AI-generated code
4. **Use Comments:** Write comments to guide AI understanding
5. **Select Context:** Highlight relevant code before asking questions
6. **Combine Models:** Use different AI models for different tasks
7. **Learn Patterns:** Study AI responses to improve your own code

### Coding Intelligence Keyboard Shortcuts

- **Open Coding Assistant:** `Cmd + Shift + A` (check Xcode preferences)
- **Explain Selected Code:** Right-click → "Explain"
- **Generate Tests:** Right-click → "Generate Tests"
- **Fix Error:** Click AI suggestion in error message

### Voice Coding (macOS 26 Tahoe)

**Enable Voice Control:**
1. System Settings > Accessibility > Voice Control
2. Turn on Voice Control
3. Use commands like:
   - "Type [code]" - Dictate Swift code
   - "Navigate to [file]" - Open files by voice
   - "Run build" - Execute Xcode commands

**Benefits:**
- Accessibility for developers with limited keyboard use
- Hands-free coding for certain tasks
- Natural language navigation in Xcode
