## Overview
An Apple Developer account is required to deploy iOS applications to physical devices, access beta software, and publish apps to the App Store. This guide walks you through the process of creating and enrolling in the Apple Developer Program, including setting up required two-factor authentication and completing identity verification.

## Prerequisites
- An Apple Account (Apple ID) - if you don't have one, create it at https://appleid.apple.com/
- A valid government-issued photo ID or driver's license for identity verification (passport accepted in most regions)
- A payment method for the $99 USD annual membership fee (credit/debit card)
- A phone number capable of receiving verification codes (for two-factor authentication)
- You must be the legal age of majority in your region

**Important:** For individual accounts, your Apple Account must use your legal name (no aliases, nicknames, or company names), as this will cause enrollment delays.

## Steps

### Step 1: Enable Two-Factor Authentication on Your Apple Account

Two-factor authentication (2FA) is required before you can enroll in the Apple Developer Program.

**On iOS Device:**
1. Open **Settings** app
2. Tap your name at the top
3. Tap **Password & Security**
4. Tap **Turn On Two-Factor Authentication**
5. Tap **Continue**
6. Enter a trusted phone number where you want to receive verification codes
7. Choose to receive codes by text message or automated phone call
8. Tap **Next**
9. Enter the verification code sent to your phone
10. Confirm to complete the setup

**On Mac:**
1. Open **System Settings** (or System Preferences on older macOS)
2. Click **Apple ID** (or iCloud)
3. Click **Password & Security**
4. Click **Turn On Two-Factor Authentication**
5. Follow the on-screen instructions

**Via Web Browser:**
1. Go to https://appleid.apple.com/
2. Sign in with your Apple Account
3. In the **Security** section, locate **Two-Factor Authentication**
4. Click **Get Started** or **Turn On**
5. Follow the prompts to add a trusted phone number

**Expected Result:** You should see "Two-Factor Authentication: On" in your Apple Account security settings.

### Step 2: Prepare Your Identity Verification Documents

Before starting enrollment, gather:
- Government-issued photo ID (driver's license, state ID, or passport)
- Ensure your legal name on the ID matches your Apple Account name exactly

**For Organization Enrollment (if applicable):**
- Your organization must be a legal entity (not a DBA, fictitious business, trade name, or branch)
- Obtain a D-U-N-S Number from Dun & Bradstreet (if you don't have one): https://www.dnb.com/duns-number.html
- You must have legal binding authority to enter contracts on behalf of your organization
- Your organization's headquarters phone number

### Step 3: Start the Apple Developer Program Enrollment

**Via Web Browser:**
1. Go to https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/
2. Click **Start Your Enrollment**
3. Sign in with your Apple Account (with 2FA enabled)
4. Review the Apple Developer Agreement
5. Select your enrollment type:
   - **Individual/Sole Proprietor** - for personal development
   - **Organization** - for companies, educational institutions, or government entities

**Via Apple Developer App (Alternative):**
1. Download the Apple Developer app from the App Store on your iPhone or iPad
2. Open the app and tap **Account**
3. Sign in with your Apple Account
4. Tap **Enroll Now**
5. Follow the in-app enrollment process

### Step 4: Complete Identity Verification

**For Individual Enrollment:**
1. Confirm your personal information matches your legal name exactly
2. When prompted, provide your government-issued photo ID
3. Follow the instructions to upload or photograph your ID document
4. Apple will verify your identity (typically takes 1-3 business days)

**For Organization Enrollment:**
1. Enter your D-U-N-S Number
2. Confirm your organization's legal entity information
3. Verify you have legal binding authority
4. Provide contact information for verification
5. Apple may call your organization's headquarters or verification contact within 2 weeks
6. Provide requested documentation if Apple requests additional verification

### Step 5: Complete Payment

1. After identity verification is approved, you'll be prompted to complete payment
2. Review the membership fee: **$99 USD per year** (price varies by region, shown in local currency)
3. Select a payment method from your Apple Account payment methods
4. **Note:** Apple Account balance (gift cards/added funds) cannot be used, except in India
5. Complete the purchase

The membership is an auto-renewable annual subscription that renews automatically each year until cancelled.

### Step 6: Confirm Your Enrollment

1. After payment is processed, you'll receive a confirmation email from Apple
2. Sign in to https://developer.apple.com/account/
3. Verify your membership status shows as **Active**
4. You now have access to:
   - Code signing certificates and provisioning profiles
   - TestFlight for beta testing
   - App Store Connect for app submission
   - Beta software and documentation
   - Developer forums and technical support

## Expected Results

**For Individual Accounts:**
- Enrollment approval typically takes 1-5 business days
- You'll receive an email confirming your Apple Developer Program membership
- Your account at https://developer.apple.com/account/ will show "Membership: Apple Developer Program" with an active status

**For Organization Accounts:**
- Enrollment can take 2-4 weeks to complete
- If a D-U-N-S Number is needed, add 7-10 additional days
- You may receive phone calls from Apple for verification
- Upon approval, your organization will be listed as the account holder

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issue 1: "Two-Factor Authentication Required" Error
**Problem:** Cannot proceed with enrollment because two-factor authentication is not enabled.
**Solution:**
- Follow Step 1 carefully to enable 2FA on your Apple Account
- After enabling, wait 5-10 minutes before attempting enrollment again
- Ensure you're using the same Apple Account for both 2FA setup and enrollment
- If 2FA was just enabled, sign out and sign back in to refresh your authentication status

### Common Issue 2: Name Mismatch Causing Delays
**Problem:** Enrollment is delayed or rejected due to name discrepancies between Apple Account and legal ID.
**Solution:**
- Your Apple Account's first and last name must exactly match your legal government-issued ID
- Update your name at https://appleid.apple.com/ before enrolling
- Do not use nicknames, middle names as first names, or initials
- Do not use company names in individual enrollment
- After updating, wait 24 hours before attempting enrollment

### Common Issue 3: Payment Method Declined
**Problem:** Payment for the $99 membership fee fails or is declined.
**Solution:**
- Ensure your payment method is valid and has sufficient funds
- Apple Account balance/gift cards cannot be used (except in India)
- Use a credit or debit card added to your Apple Account
- Try a different payment method if available
- Contact your bank to ensure they're not blocking the international transaction
- Verify your billing address matches your card's registered address

### Common Issue 4: Organization Verification Taking Too Long
**Problem:** Organization enrollment has been pending for several weeks.
**Solution:**
- Verify your D-U-N-S Number is correct and matches your organization exactly
- Ensure your headquarters phone number is correct and someone can answer Apple's verification call
- Check your email (including spam) for requests from Apple for additional documentation
- Contact Apple Developer Program Support at https://developer.apple.com/contact/ to check status
- Have documentation ready: business license, articles of incorporation, or proof of legal entity status

## Additional Tips
- **Save money for organizations:** If you're developing educational apps, consider the free Apple Developer Enterprise Program for educational institutions
- **Renew before expiration:** Set a calendar reminder 2-3 weeks before your annual renewal date to ensure uninterrupted service. You can disable auto-renewal in your account settings if needed
- **Use Apple Developer app:** The Apple Developer app on iOS provides the quickest enrollment process for individuals and sends notifications about your enrollment status
- **Keep documentation ready:** Have your government ID and organizational documents easily accessible before starting enrollment to speed up the process
- **Multiple accounts:** If you need both personal and organization accounts, use different Apple IDs for each
- **Account type matters:** Choose carefully between Individual and Organization enrollment - this cannot be changed later without creating a new account
- **International developers:** Pricing and payment methods vary by region - prices will be shown in your local currency during enrollment
- **Enterprise Program:** If you need to distribute apps privately within your organization (not via App Store), look into the Apple Developer Enterprise Program ($299/year) instead
