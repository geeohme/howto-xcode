## Notes on Using AI Code Assist in Xcode 16.1+

**Predictive Code Completion:**
- Runs locally on Apple Silicon Macs with macOS Sequoia
- Requires at least 8GB RAM and ~2GB disk space for the model
- Works offline and keeps your code private
- Best at generating boilerplate code and SwiftUI views
- Use comments to guide the AI's suggestions

**Swift Assist Status:**
- Announced at WWDC 2024 but not yet released as of 2025
- Expected to provide cloud-based AI assistance for more complex tasks
- When available, will use cloud processing while maintaining privacy

**Third-Party AI Tools:**
- Consider tools like GitHub Copilot, Alex, or Cursor for additional AI assistance
- These can complement Xcode's built-in predictive code completion
